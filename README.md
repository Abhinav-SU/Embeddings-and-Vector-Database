# Embeddings and Vector Databases with ChromaDB

A learning project focused on understanding vector operations, embeddings, and vector databases using ChromaDB.

## Project Overview

This repository contains learning materials and exercises for:
- Vector basics and operations
- Embeddings and their applications
- ChromaDB vector database usage
- Similarity search and vector operations

## Files

- `vector_basics.py` - Introduction to vectors using NumPy, covering vector dimensions, magnitude, and dot product operations

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy chromadb
   ```
